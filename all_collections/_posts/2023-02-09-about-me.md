Hello! My name is Nathan, and I'm a Computer Science (MSc) student at Swansea University looking to develop my career and skills in software development. I started building small applications and websites as a hobby last year and love learning new skills and trying out new ideas.

I have completed a number of web development projects using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript to build responsive websites with a mobile-first approach. I also have an intermediate level understanding  of Python and have also used other tools such as PHP and MySQL, working with APIs and JSON files, and Git version control to name a few. I am continuously looking to increase my skills in using these tools.  

My most recent project was a website created for the [Swansea University Tree Society](https://www.sutreesociety.co.uk/), where I used my experience with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS, as well as newly developed skills in Jekyll and GitHub Pages to generate a static site. For this project, I met with the president of the society, where we discussed the desired requirements which I developed a specification from. Developing the site introduced me to some Agile practices such as Kanban boards and sprint planning which helped me to stay focused on each step in the development of the site.

Last summmer, I designed and developed a generative art project called [DataSpaceArt](https://github.com/corndogit/DataSpaceArt) which uses weather data and Matplotlib to create intricate Hilbert curve patterns. The aim of the project was to turn any type of quantitative data into a meaningful visual representation. With weather as the choice of data, I set out to generate a curve for each day of the month, using the daily weather data for Swansea. While the project was been created for use within Swansea in mind, the settings are completely configurable and work for any location in the world covered by Met Office's Site Specific forecast. I put together an exhibition that was displayed in the Swansea city centre which showcased a collection of patterns that were generated from July to December 2022 and capture a variety of unusual weather types. I plan to write a more detailed post about this in the future :)

 I have created a few projects in Python such as a QR code generator and reader app with a custom UI, and a Discord bot which users can use to get a weather report for any city in the world and generate or read QR codes. I also participated in Advent of Code 2022, my university’s Green Book Club, and a few LeetCode problems using Python.  

When I am not studying web development or working on coding projects, I spend my time listening to my collection of vinyl LPs, indoor bouldering, skateboarding when the Welsh weather permits it and playing video games when it doesn’t. Recently, I have also acquired a Raspberry Pi Pico which I am planning to use to experiment with hardware development and low-level programming.
